### Introduction

I am a self-taught Senior Software Developer that eats, sleeps and lives everything and anything to do with software development. If you had to sum up my life it would be seen it, been there, done it and got the t-shirt and am ready to start the ride again.

### Favourite Quote

You have to do lots of things you don't like."
