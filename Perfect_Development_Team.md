# Which skill makes a perfect development team.

Teams that understand effectiveness over efficiency deliver more value.

Why:

1. Effective well planned solutions can be fine tuned to be efficient through agile development. 
2. Stopping bad code being deployed, through code review will spot efficient but ineffective code before it even gets merged. 
3. Project managers / Product Owners will have more 'Bang for the Buck' if effective well planned epics/features/tasks are prioritised.
4. Developers will spend more time concentrating on delivering value rather than repairing badly deployed features as the past.
